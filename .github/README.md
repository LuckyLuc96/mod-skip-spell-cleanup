# Mod - Skip Spell Cleanup

This mod reverts a patch and RESTORES A BUG: azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk#22367

You can use this mod to teach your characters spells that the class should not know. But if you teach them spells that require DBC edits, you risk the character not being able to be saved in the DB and effectively lose the ability for the character to be progressed.

# Use at your own risk!


The default license of the skeleton-module template is the MIT but you can use a different license for your own modules.

So modules can also be kept private. However, if you need to add new hooks to the core, as well as improving existing ones, you have to share your improvements because the main core is released under the AGPL license. Please [provide a PR](https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/How-to-create-a-PR) if that is the case.
