This mod reverts a patch and RESTORES A BUG:
https://github.com/azerothcore/azerothcore-wotlk/issues/22367

You can use this mod to teach your characters spells that the class should not know. But if you teach them spells that require DBC edits, you risk the character not being able to be saved in the DB and effectively lose the ability for the character to be progressed.

Use at your own risk!
